This is experimental code for parsing the PROIEL dependency tree analysis of
John's Gospel and generating a simple reading programme based on forms alone.

You can download gnt-greeknt.xml from:

once you have signed up there.

Running 'make' will extract clauses from the Gospel of John analysis and build
a simple reading programme in 'programme'.

Clauses are extracted by looking at any 'pred' arc and linearizing all nodes
from that point down. If there are embedded preds then clauses corresponding 
to both inner and outer preds will be generated.
